The people who might use our design would be any visitor to the museum. The design not only appeals to every guest in the museum, but it may also collect data and therefore also be of use to curators and other museum coordinators. The particular contextual inquiry participants that we will be using are Williams students who frequent museums, Williams students who are unfamiliar with museums, and a WCMA curator. For the students who frequent museums, these students will ideally have been to WCMA in particular and know where to find things in the space. These participants might also be studio art or art history majors that are comfortable with engaging with art. For the students who are unfamiliar with museums, these students will not have ever been to WCMA or has been only one time for class. This student might also be a division three major or someone who’s instinct is not to think critically about art. The curator will ideally be a professional who has been curating for at least one year. They should have experience setting up an exhibit and have insight on what exhibits/experiences work and don’t work, specifically at WCMA. One of our group members knows someone who works at WCMA and she has reached out to ask if anyone in the curatorial field would be available to help with our project. 
As part of our contextual inquiry, our plan is to first ask the two different students to join us for a 30 minute rove in WCMA. Our intentionally vague tasks for them will be to “find something you like,” “learn about art,” and “enjoy the museum.” These tasks are meant to be reminiscent of the similar experiences of museums. We will walk with them through the museum and inquire about any decisions they make like choosing where to start and what art pieces to look at. As we continue to navigate the space, we will encourage the students to share about why they are traversing the space the way in this way and if they are looking for anything in particular. We will both observe their current habits and behaviors as well as inquire about their reasons for such actions. We won’t be asking about previous behaviors because we will have plenty to learn from focusing on the time in WCMA. For the contextual inquiry of the curator, we want to simulate a situation where they need to design a space for a show. We will provide a sheet of paper and 8 small pictures of art, a floor plan, and ask the curator to arrange the space in a purposeful way. As they design, we will ask questions to better understand the structure of their design and why they make certain choices. In this case, we will interview the curator about their current actions and about previous behaviors. We also intend to ask them how they consider a successful design and what their goals are when they design a space. This information will allow us to gauge the amount of intentional story telling/narrative that actually exists in an exhibit and adjust our product accordingly.
