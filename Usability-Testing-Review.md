# Testing Overview
All of our usability tests were conducted by different pairs of two of our team members. One of us took notes and recorded the feedback while the other member ran the usability test. 

Our test protocol was as follows. We first introduced ourselves and briefed them on the purpose of this usability test, their role, and our project. We asked if it was okay to collect their feedback via voice recording and note taking and they allowed it. We reassured them that if at anytime they wanted to stop participating, they were free to do so. Next, before we started the testing, we encouraged them to think aloud there thoughts about the design of the app, the experience, or anything that wasn’t clear or effective to them. We gave them an example of what thinking aloud was so that it was clear. They were made aware that we were not evaluating them, only our design.

For our actual testing phase, our participants were prompted to imagine that they were in a museum and that they had just opened the app on there watch. We presented them with two tasks: exploring the museum as intended and exploring the museum as they want. After this point, we notified them that we would not give further instruction in order to capture how they navigate the interface on their own. They completed both tasks without any major mishaps and thought aloud the whole way through. 

## Test 1
The participant for our first usability test was Geneviëve, a studio art major at Williams. This participant was ideal because of her visual/aesthetic expertise and willingness to provide constructive feedback. She also spends a lot of time at museums due to her interest in art, so we consider her to be museum adept. We conducted the test in a Schow study room.The location was ideal because it provided us the freedom to move around and speak freely. 

After this test, we revised our prototype with feedback provided from Geneviëve. We placed the “distance from next art” number closer to the directional arrow, added a screen to distinguish between curated and community sourced tours, and added a no audio option.

## Test 2
The participant for our second usability test was Nüelf, an extremely avid museum goer. We chose this participant because he described himself as very confident in museums and seemed to engage with them at a level even higher than our last user, so we chose to move forward with him. We conducted our usability test in a dormitory common space. This location allowed us to move around freely, so we could simulate moving from art piece to art piece by having the user walk across the room to a piece of paper we taped on the wall.

After this test, we revised our prototype to make it more apparent on how to move on to the next piece in the guided tour by adding a “next/skip” button. This change led us to refactor how the guided and free roam experiences flowed. 

## Test 3
The participant for our third usability test was Kwintïn, an economics major at Williams. We chose this participant because they do not visit museum frequently, or in fact have any strong feelings about museum experiences. We conducted our usability test in a dorm commonspace like our second test. This location allowed us to move around freely, so we could simulate moving from art piece to art piece by having the user walk across the room to a piece of paper we taped on the wall.

After this test, we revised our title writing screen for tour creation to have the option for both drawing letters and speaking. We modeled this after the way Apple does it for their other applications so that we could be consistent with writing methods a user would be familiar with. We also added a screen where users could review and edit the art that they visited during tour creation before they decided on uploading the tour.
