The following table contains a summary of our critiques and how we will address them in our final design, as well as listing of the associated corrections we have made to our paper prototypes.  Image below the table contains the edited watch faces and are labeled with letters according to the fixes they correspond to.

| Heuristic Broken |  What’s wrong | Fix | Severity | Image | 
| -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | 
| Speak Users Language | “Audio after” - after what? Fix - we will add a statement clarifying it is after a number of seconds in front of a piece of art  | We will add a statement clarifying it is after a number of seconds in front of a piece of art | 2 | A |
| -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | 
| Control and Freedom/Real World Mapping | “Back one screen should be option rather than back to start”  “Replace arrow with home icon” | Clarify options for home and back one screen. We will replace the arrow with a home icon | 1 | D, E, F, G |
| -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | 
| Conceptual Model | “What is a path and what does it consist of? Where can I see my tours?” | We hope to make this clear with the option of scrolling through the past and future pieces | 2 - 3 | D, E, F |
| -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | 
| Recognition/Help | “Title with draw letter screen could be more clear. Maybe write ‘spell out title below’” | We will add the suggested statement to the screen | 2 | C |
| -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | 
| Help / Error | “Need enter button on some screen” | Will add enter button on rate-the-tour screen | 2 | B |
| -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | 
| Real world mapping | “Need a notification of being done with the tour” | Will add notification before displaying the “rate this tour” screen | 2 | B |
| -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | 
| Control and Freedom | “Should have a “clear” button on title input screen” | Will add clear button | 1 | C |
| -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |

The small issues we revised included changes to the language used to designate the effect of certain actions and clarify the meaning of certain screens.  These include the audio pause time (A), which we changed from "Audio after spending x s" to "Audio after spending x sec at art", to clarify what the meaning and speak the user's language better.  A similar change was applied to the screen that appears after the tour is complete, to clarify to the user that the tour has ended while also soliciting a rating (B).  For free roam, a "clear" button was added to the page that allows the user to enter a title for the tour they are saving, again at request of one of our subjects (C).  In response to a critique of our conceptual model, we decided to create a new dimension to our tour-in-progress pages, adding a scroll feature in the tour page that allows a user to scroll and view both the pieces that have been viewed, as well as future pieces slated for the rest of the tour.  These changes appear on pages D, E, and F.  We also changed the back button on pages D, E, and F, to an exit button that allows the user to directly quit their experience and returning to the home screen, clarifying this function  For error prevention, we also added an "Are you sure" page after this exit button is clicked so that users do not inadvertently exit their tour (G).
