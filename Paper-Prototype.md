Two tasks were represented in our paper prototype: the ability for a user to free roam with audio clip narration in front of pieces, and guided tours made either by curator or other users.  


Upon starting the watch app, the user will have the option to select between these two modes. 


Suppose the user selects “Free Roam”.  The subsequent screen will allow for a user to select for the audio to begin either automatically at each piece, or at the user’s command.  


If the user chooses for the audio to begin automatically, the option to designate how long the app waits before delivering audio is prompted on the next screen.


If the user chooses to manually start the audio, this screen will be skipped.


In both cases the app will vibrate whenever the user arrives in front of a painting; the only difference being that in one case, the user has the option of clicking the “play” button to start the audio, whereas in the other the audio starts automatically.


During the audio clip, the user can pause at anytime, fast-forward, or rewind.  


Once the audio ends, and in between pieces, the watch displays an idle screen that conveys to the user the app is still running, but not displaying any pertinent information.  The button to exit back to the main menu is always present in the top left corner.


When the user hits exit during “Free Roam”, the option to save the tour for other users to enjoy is presented. 


If the user chooses to take a tour, either created by curator or other user, the menu for selecting a specific tour will appear.  The options can be viewed by scrolling through the choices, and the user taps to start the desired tour.  


Again, the user can choose between audio that plays automatically, or manually--the same menus that appear for this in the “Free Roam” option appear here again.


Since this is a guided tour, directions to the next piece are constantly displayed as the user is walking, alongside a snapshot of the piece labeled with basic information such as the artist and title.  


Once the user arrives, the watch vibrates and the audio begins playing, or the button allowing the user to start the audio appears, depending on which option was chosen.


Again, the user is able to pause, fast-forward, or rewind the audio as it plays.


Once the user has either finished the clip or physically moved away from the piece, the audio prompt disappears and is again replaced by directions.


At the end of the tour, the user is able to rate the tour on a 1 to 5-star scale, selected via scroll wheel.
