### Problem and Solution Overview

You enter a museum. What’s the first thing you do?...

Different museum visitors have different levels of enthusiasm, experience, and willingness to explore; yet the physical constraints of museum curation means that there are no ways to flexibly account for these drastically different levels of use. This makes museums less accessible for some, while others may be less engaged due to the implicit fragmentation of content and context. Our goal is to make museum visits more effortless, immersive and complete for everyone, regardless of enthusiasm, motivation, and prior knowledge. This can be done through optional curated or community sourced guidance as well as curated narrative elements that tie together a visitor’s experience.

We chose to implement the watch app paired with wireless earbuds to accomplish two tasks: encourage exploration as intended by curators/suggested by community members and understanding the art they see. Our design aims to be unobtrusive and seamless, augmenting rather than overpowering the already stimulating experience of visiting a museum, accomplishing tasks that our target audience has shown a need for.

### Design Research Goals, Stakeholders, and Participants

One of our design research goals was to understand how our users interact with the museum. We performed two traditional contextual inquiries in WCMA on Williams College students: Daphne, a museum novice, and Fred, a museum expert. The purpose for performing these contextual inquiries on students of varying levels of museum experience was so that we could understand the full range of experiences that our users might have. 

Another goal of our design research was to understand the view of one of our stakeholders, museum curators. We performed a retrospective contextual inquiry with Shaggy, a WCMA curator, in an exhibit that they curated. We were interested in learning if and what they perceived visitors to be lacking in the museum experience at WCMA. This method was best because Shaggy was able to walk us through the space and recall their process of designing it. As such, we were able to learn how most exhibits incorporate deliberate but subtle cues that intend to guide visitors in certain directions and along certain narrative messages. 

### Design Research Results and Themes

Our affinity diagramming and contextual inquiries both surprisingly reaffirmed and clarified some of the issues we anticipated regarding the level of guidance the museum provides and the effectiveness of museum content. The initial major themes that we discovered express that users want relevant and seamless content/context in order to fully understand the art, but that they also value the ability to experience the museum at their own pace. Through considering these themes in our design process, we further reduced and consolidated these major themes which resulted in our interpretation that the problem pertains with our user’s struggle to have complete, intended, and consistent experiences at the museum. We define complete in the objective sense, meaning that users want to encounter the relevant and seamless info that fulfills their inquiries during every art engagement. Intended and consistent experiences are defined by the struggle between a user’s desire to explore at their own pace, but the museum curator’s concern that there is a valuable designed experience that is often ignored by users due to its ambiguity. This tug and pull often results in a fragmented experience that again perpetuates users not having complete experiences.
