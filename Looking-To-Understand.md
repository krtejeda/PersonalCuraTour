### Problem and Solution Overview

You enter a museum. What’s the first thing you do?...

Different museum visitors have different levels of enthusiasm, experience, and willingness to explore; yet the physical constraints of museum curation means that there are no ways to flexibly account for these drastically different levels of use. This makes museums less accessible for some, while others may be less engaged due to the implicit fragmentation of content and context. Our goal is to make museum visits more effortless, immersive and complete for everyone, regardless of enthusiasm, motivation, and prior knowledge. This can be done through optional curated or community sourced guidance as well as curated narrative elements that tie together a visitor’s experience.

We chose to implement the watch app paired with wireless earbuds to accomplish two tasks: encourage exploration as intended by curators/suggested by community members and understanding the art they see. Our design aims to be unobtrusive and seamless, augmenting rather than overpowering the already stimulating experience of visiting a museum, accomplishing tasks that our target audience has shown a need for.

### Design Research Goals, Stakeholders, and Participants

One of our design research goals was to understand how our users interact with the museum. We performed two traditional contextual inquiries in WCMA on Williams College students: Daphne, a museum novice, and Fred, a museum expert. The purpose for performing these contextual inquiries on students of varying levels of museum experience was so that we could understand the full range of experiences that our users might have. 

Another goal of our design research was to understand the view of one of our stakeholders, museum curators. We performed a retrospective contextual inquiry with Shaggy, a WCMA curator, in an exhibit that they curated. We were interested in learning if and what they perceived visitors to be lacking in the museum experience at WCMA. This method was best because Shaggy was able to walk us through the space and recall their process of designing it. As such, we were able to learn how most exhibits incorporate deliberate but subtle cues that intend to guide visitors in certain directions and along certain narrative messages. 

### Design Research Results and Themes

Our affinity diagramming and contextual inquiries both surprisingly reaffirmed and clarified some of the issues we anticipated regarding the level of guidance the museum provides and the effectiveness of museum content. The initial major themes that we discovered express that users want relevant and seamless content/context in order to fully understand the art, but that they also value the ability to experience the museum at their own pace. Through considering these themes in our design process, we further reduced and consolidated these major themes which resulted in our interpretation that the problem pertains with our user’s struggle to have complete, intended, and consistent experiences at the museum. We define complete in the objective sense, meaning that users want to encounter the relevant and seamless info that fulfills their inquiries during every art engagement. Intended and consistent experiences are defined by the struggle between a user’s desire to explore at their own pace, but the museum curator’s concern that there is a valuable designed experience that is often ignored by users due to its ambiguity. This tug and pull often results in a fragmented experience that again perpetuates users not having complete experiences. 

### Answers to Task Analysis Questions

1. *Who is going to use the design?* Our design is intended to be used by people who want to supplement their museum experience with guidance and additional information.

2. *What tasks do they now perform?* Visitors often wander and fail to follow the path envisioned by the curators, potentially missing out on the narrative but, at the same time, also experiencing the museum uniquely and at their own pace–sometimes more to their liking. On interaction with individual pieces, some visitors to be unsatisfied with the level of context and explanation provided.

3. *What tasks are desired?* More information when relevant. Users would appreciate the option for a lightweight, low effort, enhanced or alternative museum experience that does not compromise their independence and agency.  Some users would like more directional guidance, others more information about the pieces they see, or even both of the former.

4. *How are the tasks learned?* Our goal is to have the interface be integrated as seamlessly as possible; users would only have to learn how to comprehend haptic prompts along with simple navigational symbols in order to use the design. This would enable greater comfort and understanding of the art pieces, potentially increasing understanding, appreciation, and engagement, while preserving user control over their own experience. Current space cues can be potentially ineffective at guiding visitors in the right path if viewed by inexperienced people, so augmenting this seems to pay potential dividends.

5. *Where are the tasks performed?* The users receive guidance provided by the interface en-route and at art pieces. Users simply follow visual and auditory prompts while receiving haptic prompts at key locations, such as turns and at arrival at a destination.    

6. *What is the relationship between the person and data?* The visual and audio interfaces help our users navigate through the museum while also providing greater detail about the pieces they see. It also helps them gain greater contextual understanding of the pieces. The data is unobtrusive and recedes into the background of their experience. These augment the other tools that already exist to enhance the experience that visitors have. Having access to community sourced paths allows the user to connect with others by sharing experiences.

7. *What other tools does the person have?* Museum visitors have multiple tools such as the exhibit/gallery introductions, the placards next to the art, the gallery docents, audio/video interfaces, signs and maps, and even subtle cues designed into the exhibit by curators, such as placement and angling of display cases.

8. *How do people communicate with each other?* Daphne avoided other people during her time in the museum. Fred desired deeper conversation and spoke about his experience with his parents where he frequently talks with them after viewing pieces. 

9. *How often are the tasks performed?* Throughout the time spent in the museum. Once an individual is done with a piece they direct their energy to navigating to the next piece, where they allocate an appropriate amount of attention based on what they see and how it connects to them. More connection yields more attention but more attention does not necessarily yield more connection. We spent a lot of time in the AIDS exhibit downstairs with Fred where he did not agree with the message being stated in the introduction to the exhibit. He did not feel that he was gaining the same things from the art that the text was claiming.

10. *What are the time constraints on the tasks?* “There is a pace to museums”. The tasks are performed at certain locations, provided you are in the location of the piece or generally in the museum you may perform any of the tasks. Many people enjoy navigating at their own pace, based on the observations made during our inquiries, so our design would aim to support that by not forcing users to progress at any moment.

11. *What happens when things go wrong?* People are okay when they navigate an unintentional way through a museums, and as the curator noted, this is often expected. However in the Dance We Must exhibit the pieces were set up deliberately so that the visitor would get through them in chronological order.  When the visitor goes the wrong direction, an element of the exhibit--in particular, continuity--is lost.  Additionally, when people are not able to glean sufficient detail about a piece they have viewed, they often feel confused and unsatisfied.  Our design would aim to support people who want to navigate through the museum in a logical progression, even allowing them to pick up where they left off, or to simply appreciate pieces on an individual level independent from the larger context.
