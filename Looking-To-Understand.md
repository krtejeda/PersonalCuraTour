## Problem and Solution Overview

You enter a museum. What’s the first thing you do?...

Different museum visitors have different levels of enthusiasm, experience, and willingness to explore; yet the physical constraints of museum curation means that there are no ways to flexibly account for these drastically different levels of use. This makes museums less accessible for some, while others may be less engaged due to the implicit fragmentation of content and context. Our goal is to make museum visits more effortless, immersive and complete for everyone, regardless of enthusiasm, motivation, and prior knowledge. This can be done through optional curated or community sourced guidance as well as curated narrative elements that tie together a visitor’s experience.

We chose to implement the watch app paired with wireless earbuds to accomplish two tasks: encourage exploration as intended by curators/suggested by community members and understanding the art they see. Our design aims to be unobtrusive and seamless, augmenting rather than overpowering the already stimulating experience of visiting a museum, accomplishing tasks that our target audience has shown a need for.

## Design Research Goals, Stakeholders, and Participants

One of our design research goals was to understand how our users interact with the museum. We performed two traditional contextual inquiries in WCMA on Williams College students: Daphne, a museum novice, and Fred, a museum expert. The purpose for performing these contextual inquiries on students of varying levels of museum experience was so that we could understand the full range of experiences that our users might have. 

Another goal of our design research was to understand the view of one of our stakeholders, museum curators. We performed a retrospective contextual inquiry with Shaggy, a WCMA curator, in an exhibit that they curated. We were interested in learning if and what they perceived visitors to be lacking in the museum experience at WCMA. This method was best because Shaggy was able to walk us through the space and recall their process of designing it. As such, we were able to learn how most exhibits incorporate deliberate but subtle cues that intend to guide visitors in certain directions and along certain narrative messages. 

## Design Research Results and Themes

Our affinity diagramming and contextual inquiries both surprisingly reaffirmed and clarified some of the issues we anticipated regarding the level of guidance the museum provides and the effectiveness of museum content. The initial major themes that we discovered express that users want relevant and seamless content/context in order to fully understand the art, but that they also value the ability to experience the museum at their own pace. Through considering these themes in our design process, we further reduced and consolidated these major themes which resulted in our interpretation that the problem pertains with our user’s struggle to have complete, intended, and consistent experiences at the museum. We define complete in the objective sense, meaning that users want to encounter the relevant and seamless info that fulfills their inquiries during every art engagement. Intended and consistent experiences are defined by the struggle between a user’s desire to explore at their own pace, but the museum curator’s concern that there is a valuable designed experience that is often ignored by users due to its ambiguity. This tug and pull often results in a fragmented experience that again perpetuates users not having complete experiences. 

## Answers to Task Analysis Questions

1. *Who is going to use the design?* Our design is intended to be used by people who want to supplement their museum experience with guidance and additional information.

2. *What tasks do they now perform?* Visitors often wander and fail to follow the path envisioned by the curators, potentially missing out on the narrative but, at the same time, also experiencing the museum uniquely and at their own pace–sometimes more to their liking. On interaction with individual pieces, some visitors to be unsatisfied with the level of context and explanation provided.

3. *What tasks are desired?* More information when relevant. Users would appreciate the option for a lightweight, low effort, enhanced or alternative museum experience that does not compromise their independence and agency.  Some users would like more directional guidance, others more information about the pieces they see, or even both of the former.

4. *How are the tasks learned?* Our goal is to have the interface be integrated as seamlessly as possible; users would only have to learn how to comprehend haptic prompts along with simple navigational symbols in order to use the design. This would enable greater comfort and understanding of the art pieces, potentially increasing understanding, appreciation, and engagement, while preserving user control over their own experience. Current space cues can be potentially ineffective at guiding visitors in the right path if viewed by inexperienced people, so augmenting this seems to pay potential dividends.

5. *Where are the tasks performed?* The users receive guidance provided by the interface en-route and at art pieces. Users simply follow visual and auditory prompts while receiving haptic prompts at key locations, such as turns and at arrival at a destination.    

6. *What is the relationship between the person and data?* The visual and audio interfaces help our users navigate through the museum while also providing greater detail about the pieces they see. It also helps them gain greater contextual understanding of the pieces. The data is unobtrusive and recedes into the background of their experience. These augment the other tools that already exist to enhance the experience that visitors have. Having access to community sourced paths allows the user to connect with others by sharing experiences.

7. *What other tools does the person have?* Museum visitors have multiple tools such as the exhibit/gallery introductions, the placards next to the art, the gallery docents, audio/video interfaces, signs and maps, and even subtle cues designed into the exhibit by curators, such as placement and angling of display cases.

8. *How do people communicate with each other?* Daphne avoided other people during her time in the museum. Fred desired deeper conversation and spoke about his experience with his parents where he frequently talks with them after viewing pieces. 

9. *How often are the tasks performed?* Throughout the time spent in the museum. Once an individual is done with a piece they direct their energy to navigating to the next piece, where they allocate an appropriate amount of attention based on what they see and how it connects to them. More connection yields more attention but more attention does not necessarily yield more connection. We spent a lot of time in the AIDS exhibit downstairs with Fred where he did not agree with the message being stated in the introduction to the exhibit. He did not feel that he was gaining the same things from the art that the text was claiming.

10. *What are the time constraints on the tasks?* “There is a pace to museums”. The tasks are performed at certain locations, provided you are in the location of the piece or generally in the museum you may perform any of the tasks. Many people enjoy navigating at their own pace, based on the observations made during our inquiries, so our design would aim to support that by not forcing users to progress at any moment.

11. *What happens when things go wrong?* People are okay when they navigate an unintentional way through a museums, and as the curator noted, this is often expected. However in the Dance We Must exhibit the pieces were set up deliberately so that the visitor would get through them in chronological order.  When the visitor goes the wrong direction, an element of the exhibit--in particular, continuity--is lost.  Additionally, when people are not able to glean sufficient detail about a piece they have viewed, they often feel confused and unsatisfied.  Our design would aim to support people who want to navigate through the museum in a logical progression, even allowing them to pick up where they left off, or to simply appreciate pieces on an individual level independent from the larger context.   

## Proposed Design Sketches 

### Watch App Design

This design is for a smartwatch. The smartwatch will make use of the location of the visitor in the museum as well as have a map of the museum that includes the current locations of all the pieces in the museum. The watch will have mostly brief prompts for visitor input so as to preserve the experience of the museum as one with minimal distractions. The watch will use vibration for prompts and alerts based on location. The smartwatch will have a scrolling feature that is useful for reading more information if the user opts for more information while in the museum. Additionally the watch will learn the likes and dislikes of the user to help them navigate to pieces that they might enjoy. The watch would also have a menu in which the user could choose to complete any task that is plausible based on their location. If the user is in front of a piece of art they may wish to learn more about it, or they may wish to navigate elsewhere. Similarly the user may wish to learn more about art while on their way to a different location. Our design would account for a user being able to pause their navigation and engage in other tasks without disruption of experience. 

#### Task 1: Find art that you like

The watch will first ask the user one to three very brief multiple choice style questions to discern the likes and dislikes of the user generally. One of the questions might be whether or not the user wants to implement this feature. Assuming that they do, (as our contextual inquiry implied that they do) then the watch will use vibration to direct the user toward pieces that they might enjoy. Faster vibrations imply that the user will likely enjoy the piece while slower vibrations indicate they might like the piece less. Once the watch senses that the user has arrived, the vibrations will stop. Once the watch senses that the user is leaving it may occasionally ask the user if they liked the piece, but not necessarily always. This feature will help the watch learn the taste of the user.

#### Task 2: Navigate to a new exhibit 

The watch will help a user navigate to a new exhibit if desired. From a menu screen the user could select an exhibits button where they are offered a menu of currently available exhibits and choose one multiple choice style. Then the watch would begin directing the user to the desired exhibit using directions on the screen and a gentle vibration to prompt a direction change. 

![](https://krtejeda.github.io/PersonalCuraTour/img/WatchTask2.png)

#### Task 3: Understand the art

When a user has been standing at a piece for an extended period of time, the watch will gently vibrate and display a prompt “View more info?” which will provide options “yes” and “no” for the user. If the user selects yes then a screen of text about the piece will appear and the user may scroll through the information on the screen. If the user selects no then the user resumes.

#### Task 4: Explore the museum 

When the user just wants to explore the museum free from outside pressure then they may chose to enter the explore mode. In this mode the watch displays a map of the museum which you can scroll to zoom in to the map. The map would also allow the user to choose a location and receive navigation to that spot.

### Augmented Reality Smart Glasses

The AR Smart glasses insert visual and text elements into the user’s field-of-vision naturally as they navigate the museum and accomplish their selected tasks, which the watch’s software can prioritize based on pre-made selections by the user.  The interface would aim to be unobtrusive and only do as much as augment the visual effect of a museum exhibit. Due to the superimposed nature of the information, the AR glasses could be particularly effective in providing information that is spatial in nature, such as navigation; the glasses could plant directions on the physical space, aiding tasks such as navigation to a specific piece, and also introduce new effects according to the tour being explored--such as themed decorations and.  The watch could also identify eye-movement patterns of the user to hone in on what kinds of art the user is particularly attracted by, and suggest related works.  Through its form factor, the user's attention could be simultaneously on the glasses’ interface and the museum, since both would be seamlessly blended into one field of vision.  If the user wants more info on a piece, descriptions could directly highlight the area of the art piece being talked about.  This changes the paradigm because it allows for more direct, hands-on interaction with curator and piece converging into one. An added bonus afforded by the glasses’ highly compact nature is that their use would not interfere with the experience of others who would be navigating the museum at the same time, as everyone could have their own independent view of the museum based on their preferences, without affecting the experience of any other user.

#### Task 1: Navigate to a new exhibit (A)

The glasses’ augmented reality interface could superimpose arrows on the space a user could follow to navigate to a piece they want to access.  This would reduce confusion and frustration incurred by visitors as they try to navigate a foreign maze of galleries, improving accessibility of the museum for all. 

####  Task 2: Learn about the relationship between pieces (B) 

Art pieces the glasses deem interesting, or along the curator’s suggested path, could feature virtual augmented reality buttons that the user could click to toggle the expansion of interesting facts, in particular those that relate the piece to other works of art nearby.  If interested, they could step in closer for a more detailed look.

![](https://krtejeda.github.io/PersonalCuraTour/img/glasses2.jpg)

#### Task 3: Understand the art (D) 

Once the user gets closer to an art piece, the glasses could switch modes, presenting expandable text, video, and audio blurbs that would provide more information about the pieces.  The glasses could enhance explanations of interesting details in the art pieces by directly highlighting them in the users’ field of vision, accompanied by explanatory text that could be toggled.  This makes it easy for users to find and understand cool features about art.

#### Task 4: Explore the museum (E) 

Lastly, if the user is in an exploratory mode, the glasses could prompt users on nearby art pieces that may be interesting, based on a user’s browsing patterns, eye movements, and interactions with the blurbs it presents.  This could be relayed in an unobtrusive bar of translucent text at the bottom of the screen.


### Mobile App and Earphone Design

This is the design for the smartphone app. The “hero function” or main avenue for content is through audio, so a pair of headphones will be needed alongside the phone. The idea is that the phone serves as a hub for other content that complements the audio experience like a map, audio transcriptions, and visual art connections. The design is audio focused because we want the user’s attention to be on the art, not their phone. The overall vision for this design is that once a user decides to go on a guided experience or not, they are free to move through the museum and look at art. If user chooses a guided experience, they are recommended what piece to move onto next based on how the curator intended the gallery to be experienced. In both unguided or guided experiences, whenever the user spends time at a piece of art, audio descriptions recorded by the curators automatically start play to accompany the user’s experience and engagement with the art. The goal is for art understanding and engagement to be a seamless and effortless. We want it to feel like you have the curator right by your side giving you a personal tour.

#### Task 1: Explore the museum

Represented by picture 1. When the user is about to begin their museum experience, they have the option to choose preset experiences designed by museum curators. These experiences are designed to encourage users to traverse and visit art that they otherwise might not have found. These experiences are non-binding meaning you can always take a detour and visit any other art you find interesting. However, if the user prefers, they can also choose a “free roam” experience if they just want the audio content and not the guidance. 

#### Task 2: Experience museum as intended

Represented by picture 2. This task is only available when the user chooses a guided experience. Guidance arrows appear on the smartphone app that outline how the curator intended for the exhibit to be traversed. Audio content from the curator that designed the exhibit will help blend the art pieces together, helping form one coherent experience for the user.

#### Task 3: Understand the art

Represented by picture 3. This task is completed by the audio content, which is activated once the user picks a guided experience or the “free roam” experience. The audio is automatically played when you spend enough time at a piece of art. Also, every time you enter a new exhibit, you are introduced to it by the curator of that exhibit so that you are immediately situated and have context for when you start looking at the art pieces. The longer you stay at a piece, different levels of description get played which range from purely descriptive to analytical. The user is free to walk away from the piece at any time which stops the audio from playing. 

#### Task 4: Learn about the relationship between pieces

Represented by picture 4. During your museum experience, you will have the option of looking at a map/floor plan of the museum on your phone. It will automatically zoom into the gallery you are at. The app is aware of where each art piece is and represents its location with a “!”. There are lines that connect each of the pieces if the curator decides that they have a relationship. The intensity of the line represents how closely related they are. When you move from one piece to the other, it’ll “unlock”/trigger special curator content that explains the relationship between the two because it assumes that you now have the context to appreciate their connection. You can also just trigger the audio by tapping on the line.

## Written Scenarios

![](https://krtejeda.github.io/PersonalCuraTour/img/storyboard1v2.jpg)

**Storyboard 1**

Charlotte is a museum expert who wants to explore the museum at her own pace, but also wants the option of additional information sourced by the curator. Upon beginning her museum experience she chooses “free roam” where she is not offered any navigation. Then she is asked if she would like the additional auditory information to be played automatically upon arriving at a piece or if she would like to be prompted at each piece for the audio. Charlotte chooses to have the information given to her manually. When Charlotte stands at a piece of art, the watch vibrates, asking her if she wants the additional information to play. The audio begins in her bluetooth headphones and she is able to satiate her need for more information. At the end of Charlotte’s experience, she presses the back button and the watch app prompts her with a question: do you want to share your path? Charlotte chooses yes and is asked to title for her path. She presses save, exits the app, and leaves the museum satisfied.

**Storyboard 2**

Wilbur is an organized person who wants to methodically explore the museum and learn about the story that relates the art he sees.  He really appreciates museums as an opportunity to learn, and when he gets confused or takes the wrong path through an exhibit, he feels that he isn’t making the most of experience.  With Personal CuraTour, Wilbur has the opportunity to select a guided tour on his smartwatch.  A few of these are made by curators, but the vast majority are crowdsourced by other users who have made their own paths through the museum.  Each tour has tags and a short description discussing its content, as well as ratings from others who have taken the tour.  Happily, Wilbur selects a high-rated tour through the museum and follows the directional prompts that come up on his wrist.  He plugs into wireless earbuds at the same time and views contentedly as audio descriptions play in the background, transitioning seamlessly as he walks from piece to piece.  He also has the option to have the audio wait for a set time before starting at each piece, or also to start each audio prompt manually.  Since this tour is highly rated, there is a strong sense of continuity between the pieces viewed and Wilbur greatly enjoys his experience.  He expresses his satisfaction by giving the tour five stars at the end.
