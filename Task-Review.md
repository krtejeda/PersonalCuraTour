## Explore the museum 
	
Chien-Shiung is a busy shop owner who decides she needs a day off. She takes a trip to WCMA, a place that she’s been wanting to visit for a long time but hasn’t had the opportunity to do so until now. She considers her time at the museum to be therapeutic and relaxing. She flows from piece to piece at a leisurely pace and without any concern for what she doesn’t understand. She considers all her findings to be serendipitous, and in fact she’s not really looking for anything in particular. She considers her experience finished when she feels fulfilled with the amount of leisure time spent or when she thinks she’s seen everything the museum has to offer her.

## Find art that you like 

Alecksa is a high school student in an introductory art class where she encountered an art style that she enjoyed. While on a family trip to the museum she is very eager to find pieces similar to what she previously liked to see. She wants to find an area of the museum that caters to that particular art style as well as find pieces in other exhibits that relate to the art style. She is very focused because this is her primary objective while she explores the museum. 

## Learn about the relationships between pieces
	
Jorge is a high school student on a class field trip to the art museum. His assignment is to learn about how art has changed throughout time. As he moves through the museum from piece to piece, connections between the art are unveiled to him. This gives him the capacity to link the information he’s learned and build a mental map of the history of these pieces. He enjoys finding new pieces because he is curious about how the art fits into the puzzle he is building in his head. He goes on to write an A+ worthy essay and regularly shares what he learned when some aspect of that relationship comes up in a different social/academic context.
	
## Understand the art
	
Ólafur is eager to understand more about the art beyond his own interpretations; while he is good at making guesses, he wants to compare his own thoughts with those of someone more knowledgeable about art, or perhaps even those of the artist.  After looking at piece for at least 30 seconds (or some amount of set time), he is able to activate visual or voice prompts that will fill in details about what he as seen, as well as potential interpretation.  Depending on the level of technology, either eye-tracking or his user input helps identify what he has been focusing on the most, and then provides useful detail at appropriate moments.  If he wants, he can even input his own interpretation of that segment of the piece.  With each piece, Ólafur gradually becomes more adept at spotting trends in the art and feels validated in his own observations that sometimes turn out to align with those of the experts.  He doesn’t really focus on the big picture between the art, but having this information and small dialog for each piece makes the experience ultimately less ambiguously daunting and more personal and intimate for him, as if he has someone to compare observations with. 

## Experience the museum as intended 
	
Jehnifer aka Jehn aka jen aka j-n is curious in understanding how the narrative behind the art in an exhibit is supposed to work; she particularly wants to see the art as the curator intended, and fully understand the message the curator has thoughtfully prepared.  She indicates this to the app and as she navigates the museum, she is gently prompted on where to turn when she strays from the intended path and is served fun facts about the curation, as well as additional info about the art not able to fit on a placard, at various moments.  Whereas in the past she often was confused about the chronological order of the pieces since she wasn’t sure where to navigate, the guidance she now receives helps her build on her experience of the art as the curator intended, which means she has much less backtracking to do, and she understands the overarching message of an exhibit much more easily.  She comes away with a better understanding and overall impression of the museum.  
 
## Navigate to the new exhibit 
	
Sylvester saw an advertisement posted on a cork board at school for a new exhibit at WCMA. This sparked an interest in visiting the museum despite not being a big museum person. Because Sylvester is in school, he doesn’t have a lot of time to visit but made some time during his busy schedule to see the new exhibit. Immediately upon arrival Sylvester’s only desire is to find the exhibit that he saw on the advertisement. Since he hasn’t been to the space often he is unsure where to go and is worried that he won’t find the exhibit with plenty of time to enjoy it during his freetime.
