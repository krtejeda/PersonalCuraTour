## Explore the museum 

*existing task / easy difficulty*
	
Chien-Shiung is a busy shop owner who decides she needs a day off. She takes a trip to WCMA, a place that she’s been wanting to visit for a long time but hasn’t had the opportunity to do so until now. She considers her time at the museum to be therapeutic and relaxing. She flows from piece to piece at a leisurely pace and without any concern for what she doesn’t understand. She considers all her findings to be serendipitous, and in fact she’s not really looking for anything in particular. She considers her experience finished when she feels fulfilled with the amount of leisure time spent or when she thinks she’s seen everything the museum has to offer her.

## Find art that you like

*new task / medium difficulty*

Alecksa is a high school student in an introductory art class where she encountered an art style that she enjoyed. While on a family trip to the museum she is very eager to find pieces similar to what she previously liked to see. She wants to find an area of the museum that caters to that particular art style as well as find pieces in other exhibits that relate to the art style. She is very focused because this is her primary objective while she explores the museum.  Currently, this is somewhat challenging for her to do without first browsing through many pieces she may not like.

## Learn about the relationships between pieces  

*new task / hard difficulty*
	
Jorge is a high school student on a class field trip to the art museum. His assignment is to learn about how art has changed throughout time. As he moves through the museum from piece to piece, connections between the art are unveiled to him. This gives him the capacity to link the information he’s learned and build a mental map of the history of these pieces. He enjoys finding new pieces because he is curious about how the art fits into the puzzle he is building in his head. He goes on to write an A+ worthy essay and regularly shares what he learned when some aspect of that relationship comes up in a different social/academic context.
	
## Understand the art 
	
*new task / hard difficulty*

Ólafur is eager to understand more about the art beyond his own interpretations; while he is good at making guesses, he wants to compare his own thoughts with those of someone more knowledgeable about art, or perhaps even those of the artist.  Often, when he looks at an art piece, he notices specific details that jump out at him, yet that he is not able to adequately explain.  He sometimes goes home and researches pieces more to gain a better understanding of what he has seen, but often, because he has seen so many pieces at the museum, he is unable to remember every single detail he was interested in finding out more about.  Placards often don’t satisfy him because they are typically too concise or only focus on what can be seen; besides, curators can’t fit everything about a piece into 200 words.  Ólafur feels that understanding the details in and background of a piece enable him to develop a more intimate relationship with the art.

## Experience the museum as intended 

*existing task / medium-hard difficulty*                                      
	
Jehnifer aka Jehn aka jen aka j-n is curious in understanding how the narrative behind the art in an exhibit is supposed to work; she particularly wants to see the art as the curator intended, and fully understand the message the curator has thoughtfully prepared.  In some ways, this is because Jehn strives to be a very organized person, and in some ways not knowing which order to do something in, such as walking around a museum, frustrates her.  This is also because she dislikes having to backtrack through the exhibit when she has realized she has started from the wrong place.  In an exhibit that is chronological, for example, it is jarring for her to view pieces that are out of order chronologically, because she likes to spot overall trends and the fact that pieces are out of order makes things confusing.  She also understands that curators have placed pieces in a specific order for a reason, and if she is not on the right path, she knows she cannot pick up on this narrative.  Thus, she desires to make the most out of her experience by following the curator’s intended path, and is frustrated if she cannot.  


## Navigate to the new exhibit   

*existing task / easy difficulty*

Sylvester saw an advertisement posted on a cork board at school for a new exhibit at WCMA. This sparked an interest in visiting the museum despite not being a big museum person. Because Sylvester is in school, he doesn’t have a lot of time to visit but made some time during his busy schedule to see the new exhibit. Immediately upon arrival Sylvester’s only desire is to find the exhibit that he saw on the advertisement. Since he hasn’t been to the space often he is unsure where to go and is worried that he won’t find the exhibit with plenty of time to enjoy it during his freetime.  Sylvester also has a terrible sense of direction and hates maps.
