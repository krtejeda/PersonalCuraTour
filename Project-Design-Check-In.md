# Tasks

## Explore the museum 

*existing task / easy difficulty*
	
Chien-Shiung is a busy shop owner who decides she needs a day off. She takes a trip to WCMA, a place that she’s been wanting to visit for a long time but hasn’t had the opportunity to do so until now. She considers her time at the museum to be therapeutic and relaxing. She flows from piece to piece at a leisurely pace and without any concern for what she doesn’t understand. She considers all her findings to be serendipitous, and in fact she’s not really looking for anything in particular.  Upon reaching a piece, she simply looks at it for the visual appeal, sometimes considering the artist, but not too deeply; all that matters to her is the visual appeal of the art, as well as the overall ambience of being in the museum.  Sometimes something will jump out at her that she will want to save, share, or learn more about, but for the most part she is not too concerned with how much she understands what she sees. She considers her experience finished when she feels fulfilled with the amount of leisure time spent or when she thinks she’s seen everything the museum has to offer her.

## Find art that you like

*new task / medium difficulty*

Alecksa is a high school student in an introductory art class where she encountered an art style that she enjoyed. While on a family trip to the museum she is very eager to find pieces similar to what she previously liked to see. She currently has limited knowledge of art and is intimidated by other art styles, so she wants to find an area of the museum that caters to her particular art style as well as find pieces in other exhibits that relate to the art style she learned about. She is very focused because this is her primary objective while she explores the museum, and the idea of seeing pieces she has learned about really appeals to her.  Currently, this is somewhat challenging for her to do, since as someone who does not have a deep knowledge of art, it isn't easy for her to translate the terminology often featured on maps into the art styles that she might be looking for.  Even within an exhibit, to find specific pieces that she wants to see she often must browse through many pieces of art she isn't necessarily as interested in, or that she does not feel deep engagement with because she has not seen similar pieces before.  She would much rather be able to directly access the pieces she wants to see.  

## Learn about the relationships between pieces  

*new task / hard difficulty*
	
Jorge is a high school student on a class field trip to the art museum. His assignment is to learn about how art has changed throughout time. As he moves through the museum from piece to piece, he tries to look for connections between the art pieces he has seen. This gives him the capacity to link the information he’s learned and build a mental map of the history of these pieces. He enjoys finding new pieces because he is curious about how the art fits into the puzzle he is building in his head. However, he wishes that finding these connections were easier since he often has to remember facts from one art pieces to another to identify them.  Nonetheless, he goes on to write an A+ worthy essay and regularly shares what he learned when some aspect of that relationship comes up in a different social/academic context.
	
## Understand the art 
	
*new task / hard difficulty*

Ólafur is eager to understand more about the art beyond his own interpretations; while he is good at making guesses, he wants to compare his own thoughts with those of someone more knowledgeable about art, or perhaps even those of the artist.  Often, when he looks at an art piece, he notices specific details that jump out at him, yet that he is not able to adequately explain.  He sometimes goes home and researches pieces more to gain a better understanding of what he has seen, but often, because he has seen so many pieces at the museum, he is unable to remember every single detail he was interested in finding out more about.  Placards often don’t satisfy him because they are typically too concise or only focus on what can be seen; besides, curators can’t fit everything about a piece into 200 words.  Ólafur feels that understanding the details in and background of a piece enable him to develop a more intimate relationship with the art.

## Experience the museum as intended 

*existing task / medium-hard difficulty*                                      
	
Jehnifer aka Jehn aka jen aka j-n is curious in understanding how the narrative behind the art in an exhibit is supposed to work; she particularly wants to see the art as the curator intended, and fully understand the message the curator has thoughtfully prepared.  In some ways, this is because Jehn strives to be a very organized person, and in some ways not knowing which order to do something in, such as walking around a museum, frustrates her.  This is also because she dislikes having to backtrack through the exhibit when she has realized she has started from the wrong place.  In an exhibit that is chronological, for example, it is jarring for her to view pieces that are out of order chronologically, because she likes to spot overall trends and the fact that pieces are out of order makes things confusing.  She also understands that curators have placed pieces in a specific order for a reason, and if she is not on the right path, she knows she cannot pick up on this narrative.  Thus, she desires to make the most out of her experience by following the curator’s intended path, and is frustrated if she cannot.  


## Navigate to the new exhibit   

*existing task / easy difficulty*

Sylvester saw an advertisement posted on a cork board at school for a new exhibit at WCMA. This sparked an interest in visiting the museum despite not being a big museum person. Because Sylvester is in school, he doesn’t have a lot of time to visit but made some time during his busy schedule to see the new exhibit. Immediately upon arrival Sylvester’s only desire is to find the exhibit that he saw on the advertisement. Since he hasn’t been to the space often he is unsure where to go and is worried that he won’t find the exhibit with plenty of time to enjoy it during his freetime.  Sylvester also has a terrible sense of direction and hates maps, so he has trouble getting to where he wants to go.  This makes accomplishing his goal especially hard, and is compounded by the fact that he hasn't really been to WCMA, so he does not know where anything is.  

# Watch App Design

This design is for a smartwatch. The smartwatch will make use of the location of the visitor in the museum as well as have a map of the museum that includes the current locations of all the pieces in the museum. The watch will have mostly brief prompts for visitor input so as to preserve the experience of the museum as one with minimal distractions. The watch will use vibration for prompts and alerts based on location. The smartwatch will have a scrolling feature that is useful for reading more information if the user opts for more information while in the museum. Additionally the watch will learn the likes and dislikes of the user to help them navigate to pieces that they might enjoy. The watch would also have a menu in which the user could choose to complete any task that is plausible based on their location. If the user is in front of a piece of art they may wish to learn more about it, or they may wish to navigate elsewhere. Similarly the user may wish to learn more about art while on their way to a different location. Our design would account for a user being able to pause their navigation and engage in other tasks without disruption of experience. 

### Task 1: Find art that you like

The watch will first ask the user one to three very brief multiple choice style questions to discern the likes and dislikes of the user generally. One of the questions might be whether or not the user wants to implement this feature. Assuming that they do, (as our contextual inquiry implied that they do) then the watch will use vibration to direct the user toward pieces that they might enjoy. Faster vibrations imply that the user will likely enjoy the piece while slower vibrations indicate they might like the piece less. Once the watch sense that the user has arrived, the vibrations will stop. Once the watch senses that the user is leaving it may occasionally ask the user if they liked the piece, but not necessarily always. This feature will help the watch learn the taste of the user.

### Task 2: Navigate to a new exhibit 

The watch will help a user navigate to a new exhibit if desired. From a menu screen the user could select an exhibits button where they are offered a menu of currently available exhibits and choose one multiple choice style. Then the watch would begin directing the user to the desired exhibit using directions on the screen and a gentle vibration to prompt a direction change.

### Task 3: Understand the art

When a user has been standing at a piece for an extended period of time, the watch will gently vibrate and display a prompt “View more info?” which will provide options “yes” and “no” for the user. If the user selects yes then a screen of text about the piece will appear and the user may scroll through the information on the screen. If the user selects no then the user resumes.

### Task 4: Explore the museum 

When the user just wants to explore the museum free from outside pressure then they may chose to enter the explore mode. In this mode the watch displays a map of the museum which you can scroll to zoom in to the map. The map would also allow the user to choose a location and receive navigation to that spot.

# Augmented Reality Smart Glasses

The AR Smart glasses insert visual and text elements into the user’s field-of-vision naturally as they navigate the museum and accomplish their selected tasks, which the watch’s software can prioritize based on pre-made selections by the user.  Due to the superimposed nature of the information, the AR glasses could be particularly effective in providing information that is spatial in nature, such as navigation; the glasses could plant directions on the physical space, aiding tasks such as navigation to a specific piece, or following the route guidance of a curator.  The glasses would also incorporate software that would constantly adjust based on the user’s walking patterns and preselected preferences to personalize the messages it displays.  It could identify, for example, the eye-movement patterns of the user to hone in on what kinds of art the user is particularly attracted by, and follow up on this by suggesting certain works of art to highlight as the user passes by them while proffering interesting facts about these works.  By maintaining its content in a visitor’s field-of-vision, the glasses would enable each visitor to have a highly personalized curatorial experience while remaining fully-engaged with the space of the museum.  The user’s attention could be simultaneously on the glasses’ interface and the museum, since both would be seamlessly blended into one field of vision.  An added bonus afforded by the glasses’ highly compact nature is that their use would not interfere with the experience of others who would be navigating the museum at the same time, as everyone could have their own independent view of the museum based on their preferences, without affecting the experience of any other user.

### Task 1: Navigate to a new exhibit (A)

The glasses’ augmented reality interface could superimpose arrows on the space a user could follow to navigate to a piece they want to access.  This would reduce confusion and frustration incurred by visitors as they try to navigate a foreign maze of galleries, improving accessibility of the museum for all. 

###  Task 2: Learn about the relationship between pieces (B) 

Art pieces the glasses deem interesting, or along the curator’s suggested path, could feature virtual augmented reality buttons that the user could click to toggle the expansion of interesting facts, in particular those that relate the piece to other works of art nearby.  If interested, they could step in closer for a more detailed look.

### Task 3: Experience the museum as intended (C)  

The same augmented reality arrows could be used to suggest the curator’s suggested path, if the user so desires.  All these preferences could be adjusted either via connected phone app or through voice commands prior and during the user’s visit.

### Task 4: Understand the art (D) 

Once the user gets closer to an art piece, the glasses could switch modes, presenting expandable text, video, and audio blurbs that would provide more information about the pieces.  The glasses could enhance explanations of interesting details in the art pieces by directly highlighting them in the users’ field of vision, accompanied by explanatory text that could be toggled.  This makes it easy for users to find and understand cool features about art.

### Task 5: Explore the museum (E) 

Lastly, if the user is in an exploratory mode, the glasses could prompt users on nearby art pieces that may be interesting, based on a user’s browsing patterns, eye movements, and interactions with the blurbs it presents.  This could be relayed in an unobtrusive bar of translucent text at the bottom of the screen.
