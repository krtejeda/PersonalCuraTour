## Watch App Design

This design is for a smartwatch. The smartwatch will make use of the location of the visitor in the museum as well as have a map of the museum that includes the current locations of all the pieces in the museum. The watch will have mostly brief prompts for visitor input so as to preserve the experience of the museum as one with minimal distractions. The watch will use vibration for prompts and alerts based on location. The smartwatch will have a scrolling feature that is useful for reading more information if the user opts for more information while in the museum. Additionally the watch will learn the likes and dislikes of the user to help them navigate to pieces that they might enjoy. The watch would also have a menu in which the user could choose to complete any task that is plausible based on their location. If the user is in front of a piece of art they may wish to learn more about it, or they may wish to navigate elsewhere. Similarly the user may wish to learn more about art while on their way to a different location. Our design would account for a user being able to pause their navigation and engage in other tasks without disruption of experience. 

### Task 1: Find art that you like

The watch will first ask the user one to three very brief multiple choice style questions to discern the likes and dislikes of the user generally. One of the questions might be whether or not the user wants to implement this feature. Assuming that they do, (as our contextual inquiry implied that they do) then the watch will use vibration to direct the user toward pieces that they might enjoy. Faster vibrations imply that the user will likely enjoy the piece while slower vibrations indicate they might like the piece less. Once the watch sense that the user has arrived, the vibrations will stop. Once the watch senses that the user is leaving it may occasionally ask the user if they liked the piece, but not necessarily always. This feature will help the watch learn the taste of the user.

### Task 2: Navigate to a new exhibit 

The watch will help a user navigate to a new exhibit if desired. From a menu screen the user could select an exhibits button where they are offered a menu of currently available exhibits and choose one multiple choice style. Then the watch would begin directing the user to the desired exhibit using directions on the screen and a gentle vibration to prompt a direction change.

### Task 3: Understand the art

When a user has been standing at a piece for an extended period of time, the watch will gently vibrate and display a prompt “View more info?” which will provide options “yes” and “no” for the user. If the user selects yes then a screen of text about the piece will appear and the user may scroll through the information on the screen. If the user selects no then the user resumes

### Task 4: Explore the museum 

When the user just wants to explore the museum free from outside pressure then they may chose to enter the explore mode. In this mode the watch displays a map of the museum which you can scroll to zoom in to the map. The map would also allow the user to choose a location and receive navigation to that spot.
