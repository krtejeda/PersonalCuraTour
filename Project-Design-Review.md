title: Project Design Review

We chose to implement the watch app paired with wireless earbuds to accomplish two tasks: exploring exhibits as intended by curators and understanding the art they see.  Our design aims to be unobtrusive and seamless, augmenting rather than overpowering the already stimulating experience of visiting a museum, accomplishing tasks that our target audience has shown a need for.

Our design uses a smartwatch paired with audio, played through wireless earbuds, to provide navigation along a curated path and additional information about art.  The audio is best for delivering information to the user because it allows the user to be fully present in the museum, and the watch face augments this by providing minimal information that can be read at a glance, requiring only peripheral attention to understand so that the space of the museum is the user’s focus.  If we used a phone app, we would run the risk of having users perpetually focused on their phone screens, removing them from their attention from the museum--something we do not want to happen, especially as the art curator we interviewed for our contextual inquiry mentioned this increased focus on screens as his main qualm against the use of mobile devices in exhibits.  

The specific functionality is as follows: when the user launches the watch app, if they want a curated tour then they are offered a menu several exhibit tours provided by the curators. They can select the desired exhibit tour, after which directions are displayed on the watch face and audio begins to play through paired bluetooth headphones when they arrive at points of interest in the exhibit.  If they simply wish to wander, they can indicate this and the watch will simply deliver a prompt whenever they pause in front of a piece, allowing them to start the audio guide.  They can also set the audio guides to start playing automatically after they spend a certain amount of time in front of a piece.

Our supported tasks are largely motivated by our users’ needs.  We chose to support exploring exhibits as intended by curators after noting the discrepancy--uncovered during our contextual inquiry--between how our student subjects navigated exhibits and the curator’s envisioned path.   The other task, understanding the art, is also highly compelling since again, our student subjects during the contextual inquiry expressed a constant desire for more information about the pieces they viewed.  Both tasks also align well with our original purpose and intent.
