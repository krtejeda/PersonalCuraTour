## Participants 

1. **Daphne (*museum* *novice*)**
2. **Fred (*museum* *adept*)**
Our second contextual inquiry was with Fred. Fred described himself as someone who is comfortable in museums as he goes to them often with his parents. Fred also explained that he particularly dislikes modern art and therefore doesn’t like WCMA very much for that. He is a history major and prefers art that he has read about or seen before in his studies. We went to WCMA with Fred during an afternoon in September. There we several guests but it was not crowded. We asked Fred to navigate the museum in a way that would make sense to him. Fred did not require special prompting, he responded to our questions willingly and in depth. Fred moved through the museum at a blistering pace. This may have been because Fred says he doesn’t like WCMA because he doesn’t like the style of art. He also liked to *think* like a curator, often feeling adamant that his interpretation of the exhibit was the intended interpretation.

3. **Shaggy (*museum* *curator*)**
