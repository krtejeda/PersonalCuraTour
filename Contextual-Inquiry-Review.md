## Participants 

1. **Daphne (*museum* *novice*)**
For our first contextual inquiry, we observed Daphne, a freshman at Williams College. Before we started, she told us that she has only been to WCMA once before, considers herself a museum novice, and has ADHD.  We observed her for 30 minutes as she explored WCMA, taking notes on her verbal thoughts and travel patterns through the museum. Our task for her was to explore the museum in the way that made sense to her. Throughout the contextual inquiry, we asked questions that explored why she made certain decisions and at what level she was engaging with the art. We also asked questions that tried to gauge her satisfaction with the visit and how she felt about her level of engagement with the art, such as whether she was satisfied with not knowing certain things about the works she was viewing. Daphne had been wanting to visit WCMA for some time, and she considered this experience her excuse to do so. As such, she seemed like she geniunly enjoyed her experience, and she often prompted us for our interpretation of the art. She moved about the exhibits/galleries very haphazardly, and often expressed her feelings and interpretations towards the art, as well as confusion over these interpretations when insufficient context was provided.  Her haphazard, unorganized way of browsing through the museum could be attributed to the ADHD she told us about. 

2. **Fred (*museum* *adept*)**
Our second contextual inquiry was with Fred. Fred described himself as someone who is comfortable in museums and he visits them often with his parents. Fred also explained that he particularly dislikes modern art and therefore doesn’t like WCMA very much for that. He is a history major and prefers art that he has read about or seen before in his studies. We went to WCMA with Fred during an afternoon in September. There we several guests but it was not crowded. We asked Fred to navigate the museum in a way that would make sense to him. Fred did not require special prompting, he responded to our questions willingly and in depth. Fred moved through the museum at a blistering pace. This may have been because Fred doesn’t like the style of art at WCMA. However, despite of this opinion, he engaged and interpreted with the art and the overall gallery efficiently and at a surprising level of depth. He also liked to *think* like a curator, often feeling adamant that his interpretation of the exhibit was the intended interpretation. 

3. **Shaggy (*museum* *curator*)**
Our retrospective contextual inquiry was with Shaggy, who curated the Dance We Must exhibit at WCMA. Shaggy has been a curator at WCMA for five years and describes his experience at WCMA to be quite different from his most previous job because of the challenges of the space. He noted that unlike his last job at a museum that had a "carwash" layout--one where visitors automatically have to follow one path through the museum--WCMA clearly has many entrances and exits to each exhibit, and many nooks and crannies.  We met with Shaggy on an afternoon in October and went to the exhibit where we performed the retrospective contextual inquiry. The museum was a bit crowded on that day and another museumgoer even interrupted the interview to speak with Shaggy, complimenting him on the design of the museum.  Shaggy did not require special prompting, and was more than happy to explain the process behind the design of the exhibit, from challenges in guiding people in the space to the flow of the exhibit overall, which he tried to regulate through subtle cues such as the densities and visual appeal of artwork, angling of displays, and even translucent elements that would hint at the works behind.  However, he had no way of knowing if people actually do follow this path.  He also provided commentary on the nature of writing placards, and how he wanted things on placards to mostly be visual. Lastly, while he was open to the idea of technological aids, in particular in supporting the experience of people who like to wander, he also did not want technology to overpower the experience--preferring audio guides over AR, for example.  Overall, this was an extremely useful inquiry as it provided insight into the thought process behind the exhibits that our other subjects interacted with.    

## Task Analysis Questions

1. *Who is going to use the design?* 
Our design directly affects the museumgoers, although if we added tracking data to the app we could potentially provide useful data to the curators. 

2. *What tasks do they now perform?*
Visitors often wander and fail to follow the path envisioned by the curators, potentially missing out on the narrative but also experiencing the museum uniquely.   

3. *What tasks are desired?*
Attention (audio?)
Connection + Conversation 
Navigation

4. *How are the tasks learned?*
The larger pieces usually imply a greater amount of attention is demanded, when near a piece with an audio track, phone vibrates? User can choose to tune in or skip?
The connections are made internally and if the user wants to hear another view point maybe we have another audio track from the same exhibit/piece but a contrasting opinion on the piece to facilitate “discussion”. 
The space cues which way to go through the exhibit but the app is always available to show which exhibits are directly related and you may filter by what you are looking for. 

5. *Where are the tasks performed?*
Within the mind of the user and within the the museum
What is the relationship between the person and data?

6. *What other tools does the person have?*
Museum visitors multiple tools during their time at a museum like: the exhibit/gallery introductions, the placards next to the art, the gallery docents, audio/video interfaces, signs and maps. 
How do people communicate with each other?
Daphne avoided other people during her time in the museum. Fred desired deeper conversation and spoke about his experience with his parents where he frequently talks with them after viewing pieces. 

7. *How often are the tasks performed?*
	Throughout the time spent in the museum. Once an individual is done with a piece they direct their energy to navigating to the next piece, where they allocate an appropriate amount of attention based on what they see and how it connects to them. More connection yields more attention but more attention does not necessarily yield more connection. We spent a lot of time in the AIDS exhibit downstairs with Fred where he did not agree with the message being stated in the introduction to the exhibit. He did not feel that he was gaining the same things from the art that the text was claiming. 
	
8. *What are the time constraints on the tasks?*
“There is a pace to museums”. The tasks are performed at certain locations, provided you are in the location of the piece or generally in the museum you may perform any of the tasks. 
What happens when things go wrong?
People are okay when they navigate an unintentional way through a museums. However in the Dance We Must exhibit the pieces were set up so that the visitor would get through them in chronological order. Thus when the visitor goes the wrong direction, an element of the exhibit is lost, here it would be continuity.
