## Summary

We performed two traditional contextual inquiries and one retrospective contextual inquiry at the Williams College Museum of Art (WCMA) in order to understand our users and how they interact with the museum. Our contextual inquiries were both with Williams students--one highly experienced with museums and WCMA, the other completely new to WCMA and not experienced with museums in general. Our retrospective contextual inquiry was with a curator at WCMA who lent insight into the design process behind each exhibits, and in particular "Jacob's Pillow".  Through these contextual inquiries, we discovered that museum vistors have varying levels of engagement and understanding with exhibits, and often not in ways that the curators have envisioned. The curator revealed the opposite side of the equation, how most exhibits incorporate deliberate but subtle cues that intend to guide visitors in certain directions and along certain narrative messages.  We discovered a clear discrepancy between the vision of the curators and the reality experienced by these two museumgoers, one that potentially detracts from the full experience of the museum unless supplemented by other means.  We also discovered that curators do not have a means to understand how visitors are interacting with the exhibits, relying only on sporadic feedback.  With these observations in mind, we believe that we have enough basis to design a platform that will provide navigation, exhibit information, and contextual insights. 

## Participants 

1. **Daphne (*museum* *novice*)**
For our first contextual inquiry, we observed Daphne, a freshman at Williams College. Before we started, she told us that she has only been to WCMA once before, considers herself a museum novice, and has ADHD. We observed and accompanied her for 30 minutes as she explored WCMA, taking notes on her verbal thoughts and travel patterns through the museum. Our task for her was to explore the museum in the way that made sense to her, or felt natural. Throughout the contextual inquiry, we asked questions that explored why she made certain decisions and at what level she was engaging with the art--many times it seemed that the choices made were subconscious or simply based on what had more visual appeal. We also asked questions that tried to gauge her satisfaction with the visit and how she felt about her level of engagement with the art, such as whether she was satisfied with not knowing certain things about the works she was viewing. Sometimes, Daphne would make interpretations about the works she was seeing--demonstrating a different way of engaging with art--although at similar moments she would express frustration with not being able to know more about certain pieces. Daphne had been wanting to visit WCMA for some time, and she considered this experience her excuse to do so. As such, she seemed like she genuinely enjoyed her experience, and she often prompted us for our interpretation of the art as well. Her general path around and within the galleries were very haphazardly, which could be attributed to the ADHD she told us about. 

2. **Fred (*museum* *adept*)**
Our second contextual inquiry was with Fred. Fred described himself as someone who is comfortable in museums and he visits them often with his parents. Fred also explained that he particularly dislikes modern art and therefore doesn’t like WCMA very much for that. He is a history major and prefers art that he has read about or seen before in his studies. We went to WCMA with Fred during an afternoon in September. There we several guests but it was not crowded. We asked Fred to navigate the museum in a way that would make sense to him. Fred did not require special prompting, he responded to our questions willingly and in depth. Fred moved through the museum at a blistering pace. This may have been because Fred doesn’t like the style of art at WCMA. However, despite of this opinion, he engaged and interpreted with the art and the overall gallery efficiently and at a surprising level of depth. He also liked to *think* like a curator, often feeling adamant that his interpretation of the exhibit was the intended interpretation. 

3. **Shaggy (*museum* *curator*)**
Our retrospective contextual inquiry was with Shaggy, who curated the Dance We Must exhibit at WCMA. Shaggy has been a curator at WCMA for five years and describes his experience at WCMA to be quite different from his most previous job because of the challenges of the space. He noted that unlike his last job at a museum that had a "carwash" layout--one where visitors automatically have to follow one path through the museum--WCMA clearly has many entrances and exits to each exhibit, and many nooks and crannies.  We met with Shaggy on an afternoon in October and went to the exhibit where we performed the retrospective contextual inquiry. The museum was a bit crowded on that day and another museumgoer even interrupted the interview to speak with Shaggy, complimenting him on the design of the museum.  Shaggy did not require special prompting, and was more than happy to explain the process behind the design of the exhibit, from challenges in guiding people in the space to the flow of the exhibit overall, which he tried to regulate through subtle cues such as the densities and visual appeal of artwork, angling of displays, and even translucent elements that would hint at the works behind.  However, he had no way of knowing if people actually do follow this path.  He also provided commentary on the nature of writing placards, and how he wanted things on placards to mostly be visual. Lastly, while he was open to the idea of technological aids, in particular in supporting the experience of people who like to wander, he also did not want technology to overpower the experience--preferring audio guides over AR, for example.  Overall, this was an extremely useful inquiry as it provided insight into the thought process behind the exhibits that our other subjects interacted with.    

## Synthesizing the Affinity Diagram

In terms of our process in identifying these themes, we first collected insights that stood out to us from our affinity diagrams.  We then stuck them on the board in a preliminary grouping, before narrowing things down and considering the position of each post-it in relation to its neighbors.  In a relatively disorganized fashion, we continued rearranging as a group until we arrived at an arrangement we were satisfied with; after this, we then labeled the groupings, making minor adjustments to the contents of each group as we considered the implications of the labeling, before looking at the big picture and drawing insights about our users’ needs.  

*Interest in Familiarity:* If the user already has some understanding or interest in the art, then they are more likely to engage with it.  Prior knowledge helps shape future interaction with the art, and seeing something one is familiar with reinforces the enjoy

*Desirable context:* In both of our student contextual inquires, the individuals wanted to know more about certain pieces that were sparsely labeled, often having questions of a specific nature that might not even be able to fit on such a label. 

*Learning takes effort:* If the information is not readily accessible, trying to teach yourself is not appealing, requiring mental labor that museumgoers might not have. If there is no context provided or if the context that is provided is unclear, then the user is not inclined to put in the effort to understand fully.

*Timing is important:* When it comes to the placement of placards next to pieces or other information en route to the next experience, the user might not see them at the right time, disrupting their experience.  The curator also noted how writing labels is like writing a book, except one does not know in what order these “pages” will be viewed.
 
*Seamlessness vs. Guidance:* The curator often referred to the design of the space to resemble a river, naturally flowing from piece to piece.  At the same time, WCMA in particular, these subtle cues described by the curator (in particular in ‘Dance we must’) were often not understood by our student subjects, who veered off the chronological path laid out almost immediately--yet these student visitors may have been better served by following the right path.  Here we see a mobile solution as offering a bridge between these two interests.

*Conversation is a better avenue of information:* Some of the themes in the museum are unattainable through just reading and require a discourse. 

*Control and pacing:* Museums can be overwhelming so the user wants to know that they can choose when and how to engage with the information about the art. The user wants to pave their own path through the museum and be open to serendipitous discoveries, while still getting to the things that interest them. 

Despite the bottom-up approach to our affinity diagram, we discovered themes both reaffirm and clarify some of the issues we described in our project proposal, specifically the themes: “Interest in Familiarity” and “Control and pacing." These particular themes will be interesting to design for because they don’t express a need for guidance, and instead they imply people don’t like being told how to experience the museum. Also, after discovering that curator's do indeed design museum's with intended structures and narratives, yet they are actively ignored by most visitors, we want to implement into our design a way to help express the curator's "flow." Finally, while the theme "Conversation is a better avenue of information" is an extremely insightful theme because while we wont be able to implement conversations into our design (for the fear of making it feel bloated), it helps make aware that the social aspect of the museum experience shouldn't ignored.

## Task Analysis Questions

1. *Who is going to use the design?* 
Our design is intended to improve the experience of museumgoers, although if we added tracking data to the app we could potentially provide useful data to the curators to see if their curation was being followed. 

2. *What tasks do they now perform?*
Visitors often wander and fail to follow the path envisioned by the curators, potentially missing out on the narrative but, at the same time, also experiencing the museum uniquely and at their own pace--sometimes more to their liking.  On interaction with individual pieces, some visitors to be unsatisfied with the level of context and explanation provided.

3. *What tasks are desired?*
The goal is to augment the serendipity that comes with wandering through a museum with more context and narrative, providing additional guidance towards pieces the visitor would be interested in, all without totally disrupting the visitor's independence and agency.  Current museum visitors often desire more context and more obvious cues towards the right path, and our app would aim to provide that.  As an added side effect, data could be collected on the users to help curators determine what the travel patterns and interactions within the museum look like.

4. *How are the tasks learned?*
Our goal is to have the interface be integrated as seamlessly as possible; users would only have to learn how to comprehend and sometimes follow voice, text, or haptic prompts.  Learning would occur with the use of the app, and at any point the app could be ignored without detriment. This would enable greater comfort and understanding of the art pieces, potentially increasing understanding, appreciation, and enagement, while preserving user control over their own experience.  Current space cues can be potentially ineffective at guiding visitors in the right path if viewed by inexperienced people, so augmenting this seems to pay potential dividends.

5. *Where are the tasks performed?*
The tasks are performed by the users as they interact and navigate through the museum, with the guidance provided by the interface.  Users are generally passive and receive prompts from the app--although they could potentially also make requests.

6. *What is the relationship between the person and data?*
The data helps the person navigate through the museum while better understanding the pieces they see.  It also helps them gain greater contextual understanding of the pieces they see, while influencing their choices for what pieces to visit next.  These augment the other tools that already exist to enhance the experience that visitors have.  

7. *What other tools does the person have?*
Museum visitors multiple tools during their time at a museum like: the exhibit/gallery introductions, the placards next to the art, the gallery docents, audio/video interfaces, signs and maps, and even subtle cues designed into the exhibit by curators, such as placement and angling of display cases. 

8. *How do people communicate with each other?*
Daphne avoided other people during her time in the museum. Fred desired deeper conversation and spoke about his experience with his parents where he frequently talks with them after viewing pieces.  Our proposal would provide another interface of communication.

9. *How often are the tasks performed?*
Throughout the time spent in the museum. Once an individual is done with a piece they direct their energy to navigating to the next piece, where they allocate an appropriate amount of attention based on what they see and how it connects to them. More connection yields more attention but more attention does not necessarily yield more connection. We spent a lot of time in the AIDS exhibit downstairs with Fred where he did not agree with the message being stated in the introduction to the exhibit. He did not feel that he was gaining the same things from the art that the text was claiming. 
	
10. *What are the time constraints on the tasks?*
“There is a pace to museums”. The tasks are performed at certain locations, provided you are in the location of the piece or generally in the museum you may perform any of the tasks.  Many people enjoy navigating at their own pace, based on the observations made during our inquiries, so our design would aim to support that.   

11. *What happens when things go wrong?*
People are okay when they navigate an unintentional way through a museums, and as the curator noted, this is something often expected. However in the Dance We Must exhibit the pieces were set up deliberately so that the visitor would get through them in chronological order. Thus when the visitor goes the wrong direction, an element of the exhibit is lost, here it would be continuity. Our design would aim to support those who make such deviations, allowing them to pick up narratives if they so desire, or simply appreciate each pieces on an individual level independent from the larger context.
