| A | In our screen for selection of a guided tour, it is not evident that the buttons select for exhibits.  It is not clear from the buttons that what kind of tour is being selected, one that focuses on an exhibit or the entire museum, for example, or even the creator of the tour.  |  X |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| B | Need a “no audio” option for those who just want guidance to pieces, without voice-overs playing. | X |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| C | There is no option for the user to not rate the tour, but we are not giving users the option to not rate tours in order to force the generation of sufficient feedback | No revision made |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| D | The end experience button should be an ‘x’ instead of an arrow, to more graphically correspond with the action being executed | X |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| E | The user might want the option to enter the title of the tour differently--for example, to enter the title via voice input.  We will make this change for accessibility reasons.  | X |
