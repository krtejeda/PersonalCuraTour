Meeting Management
We will meet at minimum Sunday and Wednesday for 90 minutes with full attendance
If there is conflict we will weigh the pros and cons of the options and then vote
Our attitude will be focused towards using our time efficiently and addressing the tasks at hand

Accountability Processes
Check in on any individual work with two hours notice before the deadline to give group members time to read it over
We will have a spreadsheet to keep track of tasks and who has completed them to ensure that we divide work fairly throughout the semester

Rewards and Punishments
We will always analyze our successes and failures in terms of why the situation unfolded the way it did and how we as a group can take steps towards refining our process to either continue our momentum or get ourselves on the right path
We will not shame or guilt anyone based on an outcome, we are a team and will move forward together
