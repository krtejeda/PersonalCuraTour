## Meeting Management

* If there is conflict, we will weigh the pros and cons of the options and then vote.
* Our attitude will be focused towards using our time efficiently and addressing the tasks at hand.

## Accountability Processes
* Check in on any individual work with two hours notice before the deadline to give group members time to read it over.
* We will have a spreadsheet to keep track of tasks and who has completed them to ensure that we divide work fairly throughout the semester.

## Rewards and Punishments
* We will always analyze our successes and failures in terms of why the situation unfolded the way it did and how we as a group can take steps towards refining our process to either continue our momentum or get ourselves on the right path.
* We will not shame or guilt anyone based on an outcome, we are a team and will move forward together.
