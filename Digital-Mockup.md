# Prototype Overview

During the implementation of the digital mock-up, we were forced to decide on the actual visual identity of our design and the elements that made it up. We were constrained by the watch modality and the limitations of screen size that it carries to use our space wisely while also not overwhelm the user with information. We referenced Apple’s Apple Watch visual identity documentation and made sure to meet recommendations of having a black background, buttons of at least 52 pixels in width, and high contrast, almost neon, colors. We also implemented the SF Compact Design font, which Apple has tested as a font that is highly readable at small sizes. Our goal with following these recommendations was to make sure we adhered to watch design standards, but also to build something familiar that allows the user to immediately figure out how to use it.

The changes that we made during implementing the digital mock-up were: 
- Added icons to home screen - Icons with different colors help the user realize that these buttons lead to different experiences. 
- Added text to back buttons - We figured users might forget what the previous screen was.
- Overlayed the painting with a play button once that option activates - It was a cool metaphor to have the user press on the icon for audio to play. Also, we were worried about accidental misclicks if it remained in between the back and skip buttons.  
- Made clear the option to skip to the next piece in the experience: The “skip” icon is usually used in reference to music and audio, so we changed it to words.


# Task 1: Guided Tour by Curator

The user selects the type of experience desired, as originally planned.  We did modify the other options, including a “create tour” option for those who wish to create their own experience.

The user chooses what category of tours desired; either created by curator or by other users.

Select tour.  Description of each tour includes star rating, number of ratings, and tags describing the tour—in addition to the title of the tour itself.  User can scroll through possible options.

Once tour is selected, user chooses for audio to play either manually or automatically, or for no audio at all.

If user choose automatic audio, the user has the option to choose how long the app waits at each art piece before initiating the audio.  Otherwise, this screen is skipped.

The app feeds directions to the next piece.

At each piece, the watch vibrates and displays the prompt showing the audio clip, allowing the user to click to start if manual mode enabled; otherwise, the user can wait until the audio starts on its own.  Even under automatic mode the audio can be started via button if the user does not want to wait as long.

When the audio starts playing, the user can pause at any point, and also skip or go back.  This sequence of directions, audio prompt, and audio playing repeats until the sequence of pieces in the tour finishes.  The user can also end the tour at any time by pressing the button at top left.

An error-catching screen appears if the user does this.

Finally, the user is asked to rate the tour on a 0-5 star scale.

# Task 2: Explore the museum 

Our second task is to allow the user to explore the museum as they wish while still being able to gain more information about the art.

 First the user chooses “free roam”, this takes them to a screen where they decide how they would like to interact with the audio. In this case let’s say the user chooses manual.

Then they are taken to an inprogress screen that shows a walking icon and asks the user to go find some art.

When the user approaches the art, since they chose manual, the watch vibrates and offers an audio track. The user presses play to listen to the track.

They may also press pause on this screen to pause the track.

When the user leaves this piece of art their screen will again display the in progress screen.

When the user is done exploring they press end in the top left corner which brings them to the “are you sure” screen.

Once the user selects yes they are taken back to the home screen.
