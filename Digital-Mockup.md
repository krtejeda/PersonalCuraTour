# Task 2: Explore the museum 

Our second task is to allow the user to explore the museum as they wish while still being able to gain more information about the art.

 First the user chooses “free roam”, this takes them to a screen where they decide how they would like to interact with the audio. In this case let’s say the user chooses manual.

Then they are taken to an inprogress screen that shows a walking icon and asks the user to go find some art.

When the user approaches the art, since they chose manual, the watch vibrates and offers an audio track. The user presses play to listen to the track.

They may also press pause on this screen to pause the track.

When the user leaves this piece of art their screen will again display the in progress screen.

When the user is done exploring they press end in the top left corner which brings them to the “are you sure” screen.

Once the user selects yes they are taken back to the home screen.
