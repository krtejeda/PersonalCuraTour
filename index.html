				<h2><strong>Dissatisfied</strong> with your museum experience?</h2>
				<p>We noticed that different museum visitors have different levels of enthusiasm, experience, and willingness to explore. Yet, the physical constraints of museum curation means that there are no ways to flexibly account for these drastically different levels of use.  </p>

				<h2>Hungry for more <strong>guidance</strong> or <strong>information?</strong></h2>
				<p>Our goal is to make museum visits more effortless, immersive and complete for everyone, regardless of enthusiasm, motivation, and prior knowledge. This can be done through optional curated or community sourced guidance as well as curated narrative elements that tie together a visitor’s experience.

				<h2>Our <strong>Design Process</strong></h2>
				<p>We utilized fundamental UX/UI design principles in the creation of our design, understanding the problem first before choosing a design, creating and refining a design through repeated testing using paper prototypes and user feedback, before finally polishing and presenting a final prototype. 
				</p>
				<p>The adjacent image depicts an early version of our paper prototype displaying the home screen.  Like many other aspects of our design, this screen was modified in paper and tested again as we discovered new design flaws that pushed us to rethink our choices.</p>
