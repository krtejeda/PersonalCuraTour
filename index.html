				<h2><strong>Dissatisfied</strong> with your museum experience?</h2>
				<p>We noticed that different museum visitors have different levels of enthusiasm, experience, and willingness to explore. Yet, the physical constraints of museum curation means that there are no ways to flexibly account for these drastically different levels of use.  </p>

				<h2>Hungry for more <strong>guidance</strong> or <strong>information?</strong></h2>
				<p>Our goal is to make museum visits more effortless, immersive and complete for everyone, regardless of enthusiasm, motivation, and prior knowledge. This can be done through optional curated or community sourced guidance as well as curated narrative elements that tie together a visitor’s experience.
