## Motivation

You enter a museum. What’s the first thing you do? 
…
Some people go straight to their favorite gallery, the remainder wander, both intentionally and unintentionally.  

Different museum visitors have different levels of enthusiasm, experience, and willingness to explore; yet the physical constraints of museum curation means that there are no ways to flexibly account for these drastically different levels of use. This makes museums less accessible for some, while others may be less engaged. Our goal is to make museum visits more effortless and immersive for everyone, regardless of enthusiasm, motivation, and prior knowledge. This can be done through delivering better navigation and providing personalized narrative elements that tie together a visitor’s experience.

## Problem

People often don’t know how to navigate through a museum in an engaging way if they’re not art experts. During visits to Mass MoCA and WCMA, we observed many visitors who relied on prompting from the in gallery assistants because they needed help with directions through the space or needed to confirm their location. We also noticed through personal experience that it’s hard to make connections between art pieces and even to retain basic facts that could add to our enjoyment, simply because in a single visit, one might view tens or even hundreds of pieces.  

## Solution

The solution we envision is a personal curator. The personal curator will provide seamless information about relevant art pieces through audio and visual interfaces. This system also supports varying levels of guidance, while also suggesting paths for future exploration. For each visitor, Personal CuraTour aims to provide the appropriate amount of guidance and to help them discover relationships and insights between pieces that they otherwise would not have known. This assistance performs similarly to how a curator communicates the relationships between works of art while also encouraging them to explore new pieces.  

The Personal CuraTour may take the form of a mobile app where the visitor logs in upon entering the museum. Next the visitor would select a level of guidance ranging from minimal to a predetermined path through the museum provided by curators. Once the visitor is within the gallery, the guidance comes to them through mostly audio and the app will support limited functionality to promote a deeper engagement with the exhibit.
